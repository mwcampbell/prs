You may control the running PRS process by logging into the telnet port 
as defined in the config file with the configured password.  *WARNING* 
At time of writing, the password is echoed back to you.

It is also possible to configure PRS to present the CLI on the console 
where prs_server is launched.

According to prs_server.c, the following commands are available to you:

"shutdown": Terminate prs_server.

"quit": Exit the command interface.

"on": Turn on soundcard input.  Other channels are faded to a background 
level.  Designed for speaking over the music.

"off": Turns off soundcard input and fades up any faded channels.  
Opposite to "on".

"soundon": Turns on soundcard output (i.e. local monitoring of PRS).

"soundoff": Turn off soundcard output.

"n": Skip to next event (?).

"start": Start automation.  Not sure exactly what this does, might be 
related to being able to add tracks to a playlist in this mode.

"stop": Stop automation.  Dito.

"date": Print mixer and system date and time.

"N": Same as "off" plus "n".

"S": Same as "off" plus "start".

There is a function called "add_file" which is defined in prs_server.c 
but appears not to be used.
