Mixer:

Implement mixer channels and outputs that run in their own threads, to
reduce glitches in the output, especially the sound card output.

Fix the mixer so that when the mic is on, all other channels are
turned down, even if another channel is created and started while the
mic is turned on.  This way a DJ doing a live airbreak can start the
music with the mic still on, talk over the music, and then turn the
mic off.

Database:

Change format of log table to take a time and a recording path rather
than a recording id.

Scheduler:

Allow scheduling recurring time slots.

Make it possible for the user to manually alter the playlist.

Make pre-scheduling configurable.

User interface:
