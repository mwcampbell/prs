Mixer:

Implement mixer channels and outputs that run in their own threads, to
reduce glitches in the output, especially the sound card output.

Fix the mixer so that when the mic is on, all other channels are
turned down, even if another channel is created and started while the
mic is turned on.  This way a DJ doing a live airbreak can start the
music with the mic still on, talk over the music, and then turn the
mic off.

Database:

Switch to MySQL for increased efficiency and the possibility of a
Windows port with an embedded database.

Scheduler:

Rename playlist templates to programs and make it possible to create a
schedule of programs, so that the same program can occur more than
once in the schedule.

Make it possible for the user to manually alter the playlist.

Make pre-scheduling configurable.

User interface:

Make it possible for outside processes, possibly on remote hosts, to
control and query PRS.  The easiest way to accomplish this may be
through XML-RPC, using the xmlrpc-c library
(http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/).  however, this approach wouldn't
allow PRS to send notifications back toa  client.
