	* src/fileinfo.c: Fixed rounding errors in finding audio out queue points.

	* src/mixerchannel.c src/mixerchannel.h src/vorbismixerchannel.c
	src/mixer.c src/mixer.h: Added mixer channel level and fading support.
	Added an end of data flag so we can appropriately dispose of dead
	channels.

	* prs_db_builder.c: An entry in the database is now updated when the
	name, genre or length changes in the corresponding audio file.

	* src/db.c src/prs_db_builder.c: Fixed stupidity when handling
	recordings not being in the database on database rebuild.

2002-07-09  Marc Mulcahy <marc@plbb.net>

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Added functions to check for the existence of the
	various database tables.

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Consolidated the functions for creating the two
	playlist-related tables into 1 function.

	* src/db.c src/db.h src/prs_db_builder.c src/prs_server.c: Removed the
	Info naming convention for data structure relating to database stuff
	for convenience.

	* fileinfo.c: Now if you pass 0 as the threshhold value, the
	get_vorbis_file_info function doesn't try to find the audio_in and
	audio_out values which is presumably the most time consuming part of
	building the database.

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Added functions for deleting recordings from the
	database and finding recordings by path.

	* src/prs_db_builder.c: Only updates entries in the database which
	have file lengths which have changed.
