	* src/vorbismixerchannel.c: Get rid of warnings.

	* src/prs_server.c: Included unistd.h to make usleep work.  Cleared
	mixer event structure before posting it to the mixer.  Ensured that
	the end time of the last event is remembered.  Ensure that the
	audio_in is factered into the start time of mixer events.  Added
	processing for playing audio from a specific path.  Added cur_time
	parameter to execute_playlist_template.
			
	* src/mixeroutput.h: Changed mixer latency to .01 seconds.

	* src/mixeroutput.c src/ossmixeroutput.c: Fixed warnings.

	* src/mixerchannel.c: Fixed pointer arithmetic.

	* src/mixer.c src/mixer.h: re-factered mutex code and made two static
	functions called mixer_lock and mixer_unlock, so now all functions
	needing to lock and unlock the mutex use these functions to do so.
	Changed references to a variable named time to cur_time to avoid conflicts with time.h.
	
	* src/list.c: Actually returned the computed length of the list
	(which is nice since the name of the function is list_length).

	* src/mixerevent.h: Changed tim to start_time and added an end_time
	field to support fades.

	* prs_server.c: Re-factored playlist generation to support fades and
	events which aren't sequential

	* src/mixerchannel.h src/vorbismixerchannel.c src/mixer.c: Added an
	enabled flag so mixer channels can be enabled and disabled (in the
	case of files this means paused and unpaused.

	* src/fileinfo.c: Fixed rounding errors in finding audio out queue points.

	* src/mixerchannel.c src/mixerchannel.h src/vorbismixerchannel.c
	src/mixer.c src/mixer.h: Added mixer channel level and fading support.
	Added an end of data flag so we can appropriately dispose of dead
	channels.

	* prs_db_builder.c: An entry in the database is now updated when the
	name, genre or length changes in the corresponding audio file.

	* src/db.c src/prs_db_builder.c: Fixed stupidity when handling
	recordings not being in the database on database rebuild.

2002-07-09  Marc Mulcahy <marc@plbb.net>

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Added functions to check for the existence of the
	various database tables.

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Consolidated the functions for creating the two
	playlist-related tables into 1 function.

	* src/db.c src/db.h src/prs_db_builder.c src/prs_server.c: Removed the
	Info naming convention for data structure relating to database stuff
	for convenience.

	* fileinfo.c: Now if you pass 0 as the threshhold value, the
	get_vorbis_file_info function doesn't try to find the audio_in and
	audio_out values which is presumably the most time consuming part of
	building the database.

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Added functions for deleting recordings from the
	database and finding recordings by path.

	* src/prs_db_builder.c: Only updates entries in the database which
	have file lengths which have changed.
