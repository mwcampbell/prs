	* src/db.c src/db.h: Added functions to check for the existence of the
	various database tables.

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Consolidated the functions for creating the two
	playlist-related tables into 1 function.

	* src/db.c src/db.h src/prs_db_builder.c src/prs_server.c: Removed the
	Info naming convention for data structure relating to database stuff
	for convenience.

	* fileinfo.c: Now if you pass 0 as the threshhold value, the
	get_vorbis_file_info function doesn't try to find the audio_in and
	audio_out values which is presumably the most time consuming part of
	building the database.

	* src/db.c src/db.h: Added functions for deleting recordings from the
	database and finding recordings by path.

	* src/prs_db_builder.c: Only updates entries in the database which
	have file lengths which have changed.
